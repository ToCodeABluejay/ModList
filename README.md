# ModList
A PyQt app that will provide a GUI for managing Linux kernel module loading, including initramfs re-generation

To install, merely copy the file into you binaries and give it executable permissions! Also, make sure that Qt base 5 is installed. Should work on most Linux systems as-is. Enjoy!! :)

P.s. this should go without saying, but this must be run with superuser privileges
